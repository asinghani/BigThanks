# BigThanks

Big Thanks is a system built for counties and local governments to use to incentivize community members to volunteer for the county. It utilizes a credit system which allows citizens to sign up for volunteer opportunities and they are awarded credits based on the time spent volunteering. Local businesses can offer rewards (such as gift cards, coupons, free items, etc.) which can be redeemed using the credits earned from volunteering.

This application is built using full-stack JavaScript, with a Meteor.js / MongoDB / Node.js backend and a Blaze / MiniMongo / WebSockets frontend.
